# Team Undefined: Universal Wishlist

## Vision

**What is your product (high-level view)?**

Our product serves to provide an advanced tool to manage a users wishlist. This list may contain items from multiple websites and will use an api to find the best price for each item to make sure your list efficient.

**Whom is it for?**

Our target audience includes users that need a way to organize a variety of items that they would want to purchase. 

**What problem does it solve?**

This would help eliminate the need to have different wishlists across multiple websites. It will all be located in one place where all a user needs to do is login to their account to see one list.

**What alternatives are available, who are your competitors?**

Currently there are other "Universal Wishlists"

**What is novel in your approach, why is this project compelling and worth developing**
