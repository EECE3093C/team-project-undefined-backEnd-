# Team Undefined: Universal Wishlist

## Vision

**What is your product (high-level view)?**

Our product serves to provide an advanced tool to manage a users wishlist. This list may contain items from multiple websites and will use an api to find the best price for each item to make sure your list efficient.

**Whom is it for?**

Our target audience includes users that need a way to organize a variety of items that they would want to purchase for themselves and others. 

**What problem does it solve?**

This would help eliminate the need to have different wishlists across multiple websites. It will all be located in one place where all a user needs to do is login to their account to see one list.

**What alternatives are available, who are your competitors?**

Currently there are other "Universal Wishlists" sites that exist however, they are just simply sites that store a list of urls. They do not have any additional functionalities such as being able to display the image, description, and price for the products added. We are also going to have a way to be able to share lists with other users.

**What is novel in your approach, why is this project compelling and worth developing**

Almost eveyone at some point has tried to create a list of products that they would want to purchase.Although there are many basic tools that exist to accomplish that, we feel that there is lots of room for improvment. Our Univerval Wishlist will provide a unique and innovative approach that will allow users to have a much more seemless expereince when creating their lists of products/gifts
